# RC_Car

An open-source, Arduino-based remote-controlled (RC) car project. This project includes 3D-printable chassis parts and Arduino code to build and operate your own RC vehicle.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Features

- Arduino-controlled RC car
- Compatible with standard RC transmitters/receivers
- 3D-printable top and bottom chassis parts (.STL format)
- PWM-based motor control for steering and throttle
- Ready to extend for autonomous or WiFi/Bluetooth operation
